# Playlistmaker
Used to make a playlist for the user based on the duration that the user wants to run.

=>You first need to enter the number of random songs that youwant generate
=>Then enter the duration of your run
=>The script will check whether a combination of such songs is possible or not that will be exactly equal to the duration of run.
=>If there is a possible combination it will generate that.

NOTES-
There is also python script in the codebase with the logic to generate songs. This script can be used as a reference to understand logic. Command to run this script is commented out.
